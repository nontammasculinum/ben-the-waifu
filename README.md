# ben-the-waifu

===Mission statement===

Ben Shapiro is a right wing columnist which I have an innate distaste for as do many "leftists". I am a quirky guy and these two facts put together + a cool little video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0KMPpakuJc) means that Imma get some ideas. The final idea that emerged is beutiful, ben shapiro, but ai, and waifu. I will need three parts (just as the guy in the video does).

SPEECH TO TEXT (STT), LANGUAGE MODEL (LM), and TEXT TO SPEECH (TTS)

[ ] STT

&emsp;The speech to text has not yet been sorted

[#] LM

&emsp;The LM used is gonna be chatgpt-3 why? Because it is the only one I could find with a good api :p.
  
[ ] TTS

&emsp;idt you understand how much pain this is being

To use lm.py you will need a key.txt, in key.txt should be your api_key which you can get from open ais website :|
